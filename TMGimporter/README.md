Work in progress - unreleased addon.

# TMG Importer #

TMG Importer is a Gramps genealogy program addon to Import from the Project backup file
(*.SQZ) created by the last version (v9.05.000 released:3 Dec 2014) of "The Master Genealogist (TMG)" genealogy program from Whollygenes discontinued in 2014.

This addon only supports importing from an TMG Backup (*.SQZ) and not directly from the file system eg: PJC / TMG / VER.

### How do I make it work? ###

* Requires you install the required prerequiste "dbf ( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbf )" python package by Ethan Furman (version 0.96.8 or greater). This reads TMG's Database(*.DBF) files

* Install the "TMG Importer" using the Gramps addon manager.

* Start Gramps and create a new Family tree.

* On the menu select Family Trees > Import... from the menu and then find the location of your TMG Backup file (*.SQZ) select the Import button.

* If you have more than one Dataset in the project, select the one you want to import.
