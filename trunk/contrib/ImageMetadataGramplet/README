Welcome to imageMetadataGramplet v0.2.  By using pyexiv2, python binding library to exiv2,
created by Olivier Tilloy, and ImageMetadataGramplet, you will be able to read, write, edit, and remove Exif Metadata stored 
within your image files...

You may get this python library in either of two ways:
1) Download, Compile, and Install from here: http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/
2) install from your linux software repository.

Windows Users
---------------
You will find the compiled libexiv2python.pyd along with the pyexiv2 module at http://tilloy.net/pyexiv2-win32-20100311.zip, just unzip the archive in the site-packages directory of your Python 2.6 setup (e.g. C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\).

*** NOTE: Used linux to compile this one...
For those interested in the cross-compilation process itself, the script I used is at 
http://tilloy.net/cross_compile_pyexiv2.sh

    Fedora Core 14
    ___________
   Point your browser to this address, and follow the directions here:
   http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html 

    Ubuntu, Debian based distros
    ____________________________

    package names are listed below

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.

Build dependencies
==================

pyexiv2 depends on the following libraries:

 * boost.python (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
 * exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)
 * expat, expat-devel

It uses SCons (http://www.scons.org/) as a build system.

Some examples in src/ use PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/) and PyQt
(http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/) to display image previews,
those are optional dependencies.

Fedora 13
_________
This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Fedora 13 system:

* python, python-devel
* scons
* exiv2, exiv2-devel
* expat, expat-devel
* boost-python

Ubuntu/ Debian
______________
This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Debian/Ubuntu system:

 * python-all-dev
 * scons
 * libexiv2-dev (>= 0.18)
 * libboost-python-dev


Building and installing
=======================

To build and install the library, while in the top-level directory
(e.g. '~/dev/pyexiv2', which should contain a file named 'SConstruct'),
run the following commands:

 $ scons
 $ scons install # as administrator, e.g. `sudo scons install`

The result of the build is a dynamic library, libexiv2python.so, in the build/
directory. This is the low-level binding. It is in turn used in a higher level
module, pyexiv2.
The install command installs the two modules in your site-specific directory for
Python modules

To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply import the pyexiv2 module.


Documentation
=============

Please refer to the internal documentation for a guide on how to use pyexiv2.
In a python interpreter, type:

 >>> import pyexiv2
 >>> help(pyexiv2)

Alternatively, you can generate HTML documentation using python's built-in
module, pydoc:

 $ cd doc/
 $ pydoc -w ../src/pyexiv2/*.py

Or using the more complete tool epydoc (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/):

 $ epydoc --html -o doc src/pyexiv2/*.py
