To use the census report or census gramplet the sources that are used for
censuses must be indicated to the add-ons.

This is done by adding a data item to the Data tab of a source object.  The
key should be set to 'Census' and the value should be one of the following:

UK1841      England 1841 census
UK1851      England 1851 census
UK1861      England 1861 census
UK1871      England 1871 census
UK1881      England 1881 census
UK1891      England 1891 census
UK1901      England 1901 census
UK1911      England 1911 census

The file Census.py contains the definitions of each census.
